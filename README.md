# speechToText
This directory includes Python code that allows users to transcribe their speech to text in real-time.

There are 4 folders in this repo. The descriptions of what is in each is as follows:

1.SpeechToText with UI: The full-function transciber with an UI for users to interact with. All files in the folder convert speech to text in real-time using Assembly AI's API. The files are as below:
  A. 
  B. 
2. AssembleAI: The real-time speech to text transcriber that has all the necessary functionality but no UI, so the transcription is done in the terminal.
3. Jupyter Notebook: The real-time speech to text transcriber created in Jupyter Notebook, solely using pyaudio. No Assembly AI was used.
4. Non-Assembly AI Python: The real-time speech to text transcriber created in Python, solely using pyaudio. No Assembly AI was used. The transcribed text is output onto the terminal.
